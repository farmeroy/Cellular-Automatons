# Cellular-Automatons
Experiments with cells and rules, based on javascript and p5js.

You can select a rule number, the number of cells to initiate, and wether the initial state is randomly generated or a fixed point. 

There is currently an error, that the rule or type of state cannot be changed if the number of cells is very large. Until it is fixed, start a cell group with small number of cells before changing the rule or state type.
